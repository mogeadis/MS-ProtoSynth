## Description

### Project
**MS-ProtoSynth** integrates techniques of additive, subtractive, AM, FM, and wavetable synthesis to offer endless possibilities of unique digital sounds. This prototype synthesizer features two parallel carrier oscillators, whose frequencies are modulated by a pair of serial modulator oscillators. The outputs of the carriers are then routed through a set of filters, before their combined amplitude is modulated by an LFO and an ADSR envelope. The synthesizer algorithm can be summarized with the following graph:
> Modulator 2 &rarr; Modulator 1 &rarr; [Carrier 1 || Carrier 2] &rarr; [Filter 1 || Filter 2] &rarr; LFO &rarr; ADSR

The polyphonic nature of the synthesizer allows for a configurable number of voices, as the option of voice stealing is disabled by design. Moreover, setting the number of voices to 1 bypasses completely the voice allocation process and enables the use of two exclusive monophonic modes, namely *Legato* and *Retrigger*. You can watch a video demonstration of this prototype synthesizer at the following [link](https://youtu.be/yOaT1Lo720k).

### Repository
The code in this repository is located in the [Source](Source) directory, which includes the main *Max* patch along with several *Max* abstractions. The main patch, namely [`UI.maxpat`](Source/UI.maxpat), serves as the user interface for interacting with the synthesizer's controls, while the other patches enable the breakdown of the synthesizer's architecture into smaller, more manageable modules.

### Technical Details
This project was developed using `Max 8.1.11` on `Windows 10` and no forward or backward compatibility with other *Max* versions can be guaranteed. Furthermore, since this is just a prototype, encountering bugs is something to be expected. If any issue occurs, clicking the *bang* button located below the synthesizer's title text or resetting the number of voices should generally resolve the problem.
